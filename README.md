# LING-271-PROJECT
Research question: How make-up products conceptualized in advertising through blending in the USA and South Korea? Why do countries like the USA and South Korea use different source domains in their conceptual blending with make-up products? What does the difference tell about beauty standards and social values of these countries?
Hypothesis: Cosmetic advertisements in different countries (cultures) use different conceptual blends that reflect social values and ideologies. 

Methods: Comparative corpus-based analysis of cosmetic advertisement. We selected advertisements from big cosmetic brands in the USA and South Korea, and analyzed their advertisements, product names, posters and product shapes using conceptual blending theory, identifying source and target domains, analyzing generic and blended space. Then, we grouped different source domains (from food, landscape, stationery etc.) and tried to connect it with beauty standards, social values and ideologies.
